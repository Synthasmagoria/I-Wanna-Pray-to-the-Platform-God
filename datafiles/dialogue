That is a RELIGIOUS platform. It will only move once you've prayed to the platform god.
Luckily the temple of the platform god is located in a cave directly below you.
Come back here once you've prayed at the altar. Good luck!
Jump up and free your mind. Hold left and feel your spirit flow.
Relax, and surely you will find yourself sliding through every SGGK.
